## Reporting Bugs

- Before you open an [issue report](https://github.com/loft-br/multistep-form/issues), see if anyone has already reported;
- Complete our bug template issue by providing details of what happened;
- To facilitate debugging, reproduce the error using our boilerplate on [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/multistep-form-boilerplate-76qyy).

## Feature Requests

Just create a feature issue and let discuss.

## Development

### Building

```console
npm build
// or
yarn build
```

### Testing

```console
npm test
// or
yarn test
```

## PR Submission

Pull requests need at least two approves from collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Docs and examples

All commits that change or add features to the API must be done in a pull request that also updates examples and docs.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add new features need tests.
